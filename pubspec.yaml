  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/resources/fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/resources/fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Anton
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/resources/fonts/Anton-Regular.ttf
